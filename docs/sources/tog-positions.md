There are five basic positions in a common team.[4]

- Fisherman (낚시꾼, nakksikkun; "Angler")
    The main offence of the battle, Fishermen are to dash into the heart of the enemy force and decimate their forces, usually through physical attacks.

- Spear Bearer (창지기, 搶지기; "changjigi" or "Spear Keeper")
    Spear Bearers act like snipers for the team, throwing their spears with deadly accuracy, but they can also serve a purpose similar to the Fisherman's by using their spear like a staff for close-combat. Technically speaking, they take all long-range matters into their own hands.
- Scout (탐색꾼, 探索꾼; "tamsaegkkun" or "Observer")
    Scouts will usually run ahead and investigate enemy forces for info, then return and deliver the information to the Light Bearers. They also help the Fishermen with offence.
- Light Bearer (등대지기, 燈臺; "deungdaejigi" or "Lighthouse Keeper")
    Light Bearers store and deliver knowledge to their team-mates while guiding them with the light of their Lighthouse.
- Wave Controller (파도잡이, 波濤잡이; "padojabi" or "Waver")
    Wave Controllers are the directors of the battle, aiding their comrades by healing their wounds, annihilating enemy forces or subtly changing the tide of the battle, all through the use of Shinsoo. There are many variations of this Position.

Special Positions

- **Guide** (길잡이, giljab'i; "Pathfinder" or "Assistant")
    The Guide is considered a Special Position, but it doesn't seem to be a variation of a main Position. Guides lead the way for the team, they also have excellent analysis skills. It is a very rare Position and they are considered "blessed" by The Tower.
- **Defender** (디펜더, dipendeo)
    Defender's main aim is to protect the Light Bearer and/or Spear Bearer.
- **Anima** (부리미, burimi; "Subjugator")
    An Anima controls living beings, commonly Shinheuh. It seems it's more a talent than a technique, as one cannot just become an Anima through learning.
- **Wonsulsa** (원술사, 圓術師; "Circle-technique user" or "Circler")
    A Wonsulsa is able to create a perfect circle of Shinsoo, causing it to gain much greater strength while retaining the same Myun and Soo.
- **Dansulsa** (斷술사, 단術師; "Pressure-technique user"? or "Pressurer"?)
    Dansul is the ability to, from far away, create an area with an enormously large amount of shinsoo pressure. Dansulsa may be a sub-category of Wave Controllers.
- **Hwayeomsa** (화염사, 火炎師; "Flame user" or "Flamer")
    Though never officially confirmed, it seems a Flame user is a person able to somehow form flames from shinsoo currents.
- **Jeonsulsa** (전술사, 電術師; "Lightning User" or "Lightninger")
   Though never officially confirmed, it seems a Lightning user is a person able to somehow form electricity from shinsoo currents.

# Fisherman

Fisherman (낚시꾼, nakksikkun or "Angler") is said to be the epitome of all Positions.[1] The Position is suited for close to medium-range combatants and the main offence of the team. Fishermen tend to use Reel and Needles. Swords and other flat bladed weaponry are scarce in the Tower the higher the Floor one goes. This is because of their impeding level of drag, a detriment to weapons with larger surface area, in high density shinsoo environments that are common on the higher Floors of the Tower.

### About

A Fisherman generally possess the most destructive power in man-to-man fights. They usually carry light arms, with no heavy weapons. Fishermen are divided into two classes: Reel Fishermen, who use Reel Inventories to attack their enemy at medium range, or Man-to-man Fishermen, who go directly on the offensive at close range. The Fishermen constitute the main offensive force of a team and are usually at the centre of a battle.

### Basic Arming (Ranker)

- 1 to 2 Arms Inventory (medium)
- 1 Armor Inventory (small)
- 1 Reel Inventory (20 mun)

# Scout
> https://towerofgod.fandom.com/wiki/Scout

The Scout (탐색꾼, 探索꾼, tamsaegkkun) is the Position for literally scouting. They move ahead of the group, observe the environment and situation. They also aid the Fishermen as secondary offence.

### About

Scouts are usually lightly armed for the intention to be agile and swift in movement and thinking. They usually play the role of helping the Fishermen regain a foothold or keeping watch of the enemy's movements. However, in terms of frequency and risk of combat, a Scout is a step above the Fisherman as they are often the first to encounter the enemy (e.g. Ship Leesoo encountering the Bull). Scout is a position which regards mental strength as very important, so someone who possesses weak mental strength can't be a Scout.[1]

They read the change of Shinsoo and collect visible data about the environment and enemies, using Observers, which then transfer gathered information back to the Light Bearers. They are basically divided into two types: The Basic Scouts generally work on gathering information for the Light Bearers and keep watch whilst the Battle Valuing Scouts focus on backing up the Fishermen in close-range combat.

### Basic Arming (Ranker)

- 2 Observers
    An Observer (옵저버, objeobeo) is a special device used by Scouts. Their main use is to collect visual data and pass the information on to both the Scout[1] themselves and also to allied Light Bearers, who in turn analyse these data and coordinate their own team accordingly.
- 1 Inventory (small, with the intention of light movement and light weapons)

### Techniques used by Scouts

- **Black Fish:** A much used Shinsoo technique that blocks out light, thereby making the scout "invisible". This is both used to hinder the attack of Fishermen and Spear Bearers and is just as important to help the Scout's Observers.
- **Hologram:** Using an Observer, the Scout can create a hologram of themselves to trap the enemy. The hologram can move like the real thing, but it disappears when it is attacked.

# Spear Bearer 

Spear Bearer (창지기, 搶지기, changjigi) is the Position that snipes the opponent and backs up the Fishermen using Spears. Spear Bearers comprise the long range offence of the team.

### About

Spear Bearers do not tend to be very powerful in a melee, but are very valuable due to their pinpoint attacking from a distance. Some carry Needles when in the front, bearing the possibility of a melee in mind, but most don't. They carry inventories, specially created for holding spears, called Pipes which are quite heavy. They are basically divided into two types, the Short-distance type, who use their spears to hit enemy weak points in the midst of a battle, and the Long-distance type, who snipe from far away. The role of a Spear Bearer is to provide backup for the Fishermen by keeping up a constant attack on the enemy's weak points.

With support of Lighthouse, an accomplished Spear Bearer is able to throw a spear tens of kilometres away. The Lighthouse has a feature which can adjust and guide the trajectory of the spear.

### Basic Arming (Ranker)

- 1 Pipe
- 1 Armour Inventory(-ies) (medium)

# Light Bearer

Light Bearer (등대지기, 燈臺지기, deungdaejigi; "one who protects the Lighthouse" or "Lighthouse Keeper") is a Position which uses exploring devices called Lighthouses to gain information on the battle or the surroundings.

Also, a Light Bearer tends to gather information and formulate plans with the help of such information as they command their Lighthouse. They are also called Lighthouse keepers because they protect the Lighthouse. However, a Light Bearer must still be able to fulfil both roles as there may be times when they are expected to assume another role.

### About

Lighthouses are glowing devices made of Suspendium and are used for gathering information to aid the Light Bearer's teammates in battle. The more Suspendium the Lighthouse possess, the better the Lighthouse shall be.[1]Some Lighthouses have an Observer function but as their mobility decreases, they become harder to handle. Light Bearers tends to pair up with Guidesand they provide information and the Guides lead the way.[2] The battles in The Tower are fought mostly in dark places, so it is very hard to battle without Light Bearers. A Light Bearer may take a frontal or rear position.

When assuming a frontal position, the Light Bearer participates in combat themselves and gathers information on enemy weaknesses, using Lights. Such Light Bearers must have exceptional Shinsoocontrol and be able to maintain control of their Lighthouses.[3] They must be able to extend the reach of their Light cubes for a good distance, so their Lights can gather information about the environment and the battles which are transmitted to the Lighthouse. As there may be more than 2 to 3 battles at once, their Lights must be extended far enough to be able to attack a large area or cover them so the Light Bearer can analyse the situation.[4]

When taking the rear position, the Light Bearer observes battles from a distance and collects data to use in future strategies. They basically control a Lighthouse which serves as a battle command centre. Using information collected by smaller Lighthouses they form strategies to direct and control the tide of a battle. They also issue instructions to their team members and, based on their feedback, decide on the next actions to take.[5] Because of this, a Light Bearer must be very knowledgeable, sharp, resourceful, good at analysing information and be able to come up with alternative strategies if their team is in a tight spot or if a previous plan has failed. Combat ability of these types of Light Bearers can't be lacking as they must be able to defend their Lighthouse if the enemy decides to attack it.

### Basic Arming (Ranker)

- 1 Lighthouse body
- 3-4 Small Lighthouses
- 1-2 Armor Inventory(-ies) (medium)

# Wave Controller

Wave Controller (파도잡이, 波濤잡이, padojab-i) is a Position where one helps their allies in battles by attacking the enemy or by aiding the team using Shinsoo. Out of all the five ordinary Positions, Wave Controller is the rarest to be chosen for.

### About

Even for a rare Position, the Wave Controller Position comes with extreme individual variations. There are Wave Controllers who recklessly attack the enemy and there are those change the tide of the battle by subtly altering the flow of the Shinsoo.

Since the ability to use raw Shinsoo at a level of efficiency that makes it more powerful than combining it with weaponry is quite rare, there are only handful of Wave Controllers as the traditional meaning, even among the Rankers. Most Wave Controllers lean to the powers of Shinsoo-manipulating items, but there are those who manipulate Shinsoo without any item whatsoever.

There are basically two types of Wave Controllers: Attacking-type and Support-type, but this kind of categorising is not used much. Wave Controllers are described as the directors of battles. Most of them have direct battle abilities and serve other Positions as well.[1]

Note: Apparently, Wave Controller doesn't necessarily refer to a person who manipulates Shinsoo but the conventional meaning of this term basically is used also in the Outer Tower. In this sense, it probably refers to a non-human like a Shinheuh species or even possibly an artificial organism or anything technological that can manipulate Shinsoo without an item.[1]

### Basic Arming (Ranker)

- A Wand
