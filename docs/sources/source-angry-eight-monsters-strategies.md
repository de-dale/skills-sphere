Which is just fine because D&D is an interactive storytelling game. But you can’t forget that second part. It’s an interactive storytelling GAME. A story archetype is a good starting point for character creation, but ultimately the archetype also has to serve a design purpose. When you designed a new class, you had to come up with three things: an **archetype** for what the class WAS in the story, the **power source** from which the class derived it’s abilities, and the **role** that the character would play in combat.

* Bruisers 
* Snipers 
* Skirmishers 
* Sappers 
* Healers 
* Zoners 
* Blockers 
* Buffers

Anyway, my eight strategies so far.

**Bruisers** are offensive monsters that overpower PC defenses. They have some way of punching through defenses, either by boosting their attack roll or by boosting their damage roll. A lone bruiser is the sort of monster that sets up a combo action. For example, a creature that relies on an ambush attack \(which grants bonus damage\) is a good example of a bruiser. Group bruisers might be the sorts of creatures that get a bonus to attacks or damage or both when they team up with adjacent allies. Or they might be the sort of monster that grants allies bonuses to attack and damage. That would also be a bruiser strategy, since it is increasing the overall damage of the enemy party to overpower PC defenses. Notice, though, that bruisers aren’t simply creatures with high attack rolls and/or high damage. That’s not a strategy. It’s a stat. And besides, there is nothing interesting about a monster whose only trick is “dealing damage.” That said, of all the offensive monsters, bruisers probably deal the most damage with their basic attacks.

**Snipers** and **Skirmishers** are closely related offensive monsters that specialize in putting damage right where they want it. Snipers rely on ranged attacks which allow them to target distant enemies. Skirmishers are able to avoid, outmaneuver, or disengage from PCs in order to reach priority targets. Both rely on taking out soft or dangerous targets, like squishy PC wizards, healers, or ranged attackers. Lone snipers and skirmishers NEED a defensive strategy to survive long.

**Sappers** are offensive monsters that focus on reducing enemy defenses somehow. They might spit acid that destroys armor or they might curse someone to reduce their saving throws. Lone sappers would probably be combo monsters. They would use one action to knock down a foe, for example, and then the next action would take advantage of the prone foe’s reduced defenses. In fact, lone sappers would be ideal for a second offensive strategy. Set them up then knock them down.

**Healers** should only be used rarely. Healers are defensive monsters that specialize in undoing the progress that the PCs have made. And THAT sucks. Seriously. Given the choice between overcoming 5 HP of damage reduction and watching a monster heal 5 HP of damage, most players would prefer the damage reduction. Healing feels like you’re robbing them of progress. Still, it is a viable strategy for a particularly hateful monster and it does drive strategic thinking \(take out the healer first\). Healing can include self-healing, regeneration, life drain, or clerical magic. Healers are basically the opposite of Bruisers.

**Zoners** and **Blockers** are bother closely related and exist in the opposite space as Skirmishers and Snipers. Both essentially exist to remove offensive options. Zoners can control movement. They can lock foes down, push them around, slow them down, or create areas of dangerous or difficulty terrain in order to keep the PCs from reaching the prime targets or from escaping the most dangerous offensive monsters. Blockers hamper or control enemy targeting. They might absorb attacks for adjacent allies, they might impose penalties on attacking certain targets, they might use taunts, oaths, or other forced targeting mechanics, and so on.

Finally, **Buffers** serve as the counterpoint to Sappers. Buffers increase their own or their allies’ defenses in some way. They might grant armor bonuses to adjacent allies, they might give temporary hit points \(which aren’t the same as healing\), or they might grant resistances to specific types of damage, or they might somehow provide cover.
